INDO README

**********************************Introduction*************************************

Here is my code for an APCS assignment about processing logical expressions.

Given a logical expression with proposition constants represented as lower case letters and logical operators (=> <=> | & ~) with the usual significance of these symbols, we were required to write code that would transform the expression into CNF using the INDO procedure.

My code is able to process all of the given symbols as well as parenthesis, following all of the rules of INDO logical processing outlined in the Stanford Logic Course.
I wrote several test cases and encapsulated my code so that each step of INDO corresponded to a separate method invocation that can be tested in isolation.

*****************************Overview of the code**********************************

There are 7 main parts to my code. 
1. Constructor

The constructor runs all four steps of INDO on the String parameter it is given.

2. FindWords

This is a method in which I encapsulated code that takes a string and, using the 
space as a delimiter, makes each word an element of an ArrayList.

3. Implication
	A. Implication()
	The implication method is the main one and runs all other methods concerning 
	implication. It starts by running findWords() on its parameter, a String s. 
	It then parses through the returned ArrayList to find the implication symbol.
	Depending on the symbol, it then runs one of the following methods. 
	B. Biconditional 
	This method takes an ArrayList lst representing words in String s, as well as String s
	and int i, which is the index of the biconditional symbol. 
	It returns a new string translating the biconditional into an | symbol
	and adding ~ before the appropriate variables.
	C. NotPrev
	This method adds a ~ symbol to the variable before the => symbol, then returns the
	altered string.
	D. NotNext
	This method adds a ~ symbol to the variable after the <= symbol, then returns the
	altered string.
	E. Implies
	This code changes the implication sign to |. It runs every time
	the symbol is not a biconditional.
	
4. Negation
	A. Negation()
	This method runs every time INDO is run and takes the end result
	from Implication as a parameter. It removes any double ~ symbols.
	If there is a negation symbol to be distributed, it runs distNeg().
	It calls itself recursively until it can not be simplified further
	using negation.
	B. distNeg()
	This method distributes the ~ sign across each variable in parenthesis.
	It also makes each operator the opposite one. 
	For example, ~(a & b) would become ~a | ~b.
	
5. Distribution
	A. Distribution()
	 The most important method concerning distribution that returns
	 the string it is given as a parameter with any operations 
	 outside the parenthesis distributed throughout the parenthesis
	 and any unecessary parethesis removed. 
	B. SameOp()
	If the operator outside the parenthesis matches the operator
	inside the parenthesis then the parenthesis are removed through 
	this method.
	C. DiffOp()
	If the operator outside the parenthesis does not match the operator
	inside the parenthesis then the outer operator must be distributed
	across the variables. This is done through diffOp.
6. Operators	 
	 A. Operators()
	 This is the final step in the INDO process. This step translates
	 the string into set form. The symbol & signifies a new set while 
	 | signifies a new term in the same set.
7. Test Cases
	A. Main
	The main method sets up the table heading and invokes testCase
	for many different test cases.
	B. TestCase
	This method runs INDO for the test cases it is given from main.
	It also sets up the formatting of the table.
